# GreenNode vBackup MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for **vBackup** on GreenNode —
scheduled, policy-driven backups of vServer instances and their volumes and of
vDB databases, the restore points they produce, and the history of backup and
restore runs.

**68 tools + 9 prompts**, covering every operation the vBackup gateway
publishes. 41 tools are available in the default read-only mode; the 27 write
tools need `--allow-write`.

vBackup is built on vServer and is normally used to protect it, so this server
mirrors [`vserver-mcp-server`](../vserver-mcp-server): same region split, same
auth, same handler/model layering. It is a different product from vServer's
block-level **snapshots** — those stay in the vServer server.

## Configuration

Credentials are read from `~/.greennode/credentials` and `~/.greennode/config`
(INI format, shared with greennode-cli; `GRN_*` env vars override — see the
repo-root CLAUDE.md).

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GRN_CLIENT_ID` | Override client_id |
| `GRN_CLIENT_SECRET` | Override client_secret |
| `GRN_PROFILE` | Select profile (default: `default`) |
| `GRN_DEFAULT_REGION` | Override region |
| `GRN_PROJECT_ID` | Override project_id |

| Region | Gateway |
|---|---|
| `HCM-3` (default) | `https://hcm-3.api.vngcloud.vn/vbackup-gateway` |
| `HAN` | `https://han-1.api.vngcloud.vn/vbackup-gateway` |

Every tool takes a `region` parameter. The two gateways see different
resources — if something isn't found in one, try the other.

## Running

```bash
# Read-only mode (default) — 41 tools
uv run vbackup-mcp-server

# Enable create/update/delete operations — 68 tools
uv run vbackup-mcp-server --allow-write

# HTTP transport (e.g. behind a gateway or in a container)
uv run vbackup-mcp-server --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Over **stdio** the server uses the configured service account. Over
**streamable-http** it prefers the caller's IAM bearer token from the
`Authorization` header, falling back to the service account; with neither it
answers `401`.

### MCP client config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vbackup": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/greennode-mcp", "vbackup-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### Catalogue and discovery

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backends` | read | Backends visible to the caller; `id` is the `backendId` every create needs |
| `get_configuration` | read | Platform limits a policy must respect — hourly intervals, retention ceilings, open hours |
| `list_protected_servers` | read | Instance IDs that already have a backup server (membership check only) |

### Backup destinations (the console's *Backup Location*)

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backup_destinations` | read | Where backups land, with quota, usage, soft delete and lock |
| `get_backup_destination` | read | One destination, read fresh — how every edit is verified |
| `list_backup_destination_servers` | read | vServer resources stored here; **what a delete would destroy** |
| `list_backup_destination_databases` | read | vDB resources stored here (item shape unverified — see CLAUDE.md) |
| `list_backup_destination_tags` | read | Tags on a destination; `vng.*` are platform-set and not editable |
| `list_backup_destination_history` | read | Config changes incl. failed attempts and the values used; account-wide when `destination_id` is omitted |
| `list_backup_products` | read | Products vBackup covers — the `product` string a create needs |
| `list_backup_regions` | read | Storage regions per product; a create takes `region_id`, **not** `id` |
| `create_backup_destination` | write | Create a location: product, region, quota, soft delete, lock |
| `update_backup_destination_name` | write | Rename; display name only, ids are unaffected |
| `update_backup_destination_max_quota` | write | Set the GB ceiling — runs FAIL once it is reached |
| `update_backup_destination_soft_delete` | write | Recycle bin; deleted backups stay billed for the retention |
| `update_backup_destination_vault_lock` | write | Retention lock — **becomes permanent**, see the guardrails below |
| `delete_backup_destination` | destructive | Delete the location **and the backups stored in it** |

### Backup policies

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backup_policies` | read | Policies with a flattened `schedule.summary` and how many servers use each |
| `get_backup_policy` | read | One policy, cadence by cadence — read before updating |
| `create_backup_policy` | write | Create a schedule (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly toggles + retention) |
| `update_backup_policy` | write | Replace a schedule wholesale; affects every server using it |
| `update_default_backup_policy` | write | Make one policy the default, demoting whichever holds it now |
| `delete_backup_policy` | destructive | Remove a policy; refused while servers are attached |

### Backup servers (protected instances)

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backup_servers` | read | Protected servers with policy, destination and per-disk flags; filter by `server_id` |
| `get_backup_server` | read | One backup server, read fresh (the list is cached) |
| `list_backup_server_volumes` | read | Which disks are included in runs, with size and usage |
| `list_backup_server_points` | read | Restore points a server holds, with the policy as it was at run time |
| `get_backup_statistics` | read | Account coverage and outcome counters — pass `project_id` or the ratio is meaningless |
| `get_vserver_instance` | read | The vServer machine behind a backup server (name, state, flavour, image) |
| `get_backup_server_point_download_urls` | read | Signed download links for a restore point — **the links are credentials** |
| `create_backup_server` | write | Protect instances with a chosen policy, destination and disk selection |
| `update_backup_server_volumes` | write | Include or exclude one disk from future runs |
| `update_backup_server_policy` | write | Attach a different schedule |
| `update_backup_server_destination` | write | Write future runs elsewhere; existing points stay put and stay billed |
| `start_backup` | write | Run a backup now ("Back now"), outside the schedule |
| `delete_backup_server_point` | destructive | Delete ONE restore point |
| `enable_backup_server` | write | Resume a paused schedule |
| `disable_backup_server` | write | Pause the schedule; restore points are kept and still billed |
| `delete_backup_server` | destructive | Delete the backup server **and every restore point it holds** |

### Backup databases (protected vDB instances)

The vDB half of vBackup. It shares policies, destinations and the history
service with the backup-server family but nothing else — a database never
appears in a backup-server listing, and each call answers `200` with an empty
list rather than an error when asked about the wrong product.

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backup_databases` | read | Protected databases with engine, policy, destination and stored size |
| `get_backup_database` | read | One backup database, read fresh (the list is cached) |
| `list_backup_database_points` | read | Restore points a database holds, with stored and uncompressed sizes |
| `list_protected_databases` | read | vDB instance ids of one engine family that are already protected |
| `list_databases` | read | The vDB estate with per-instance eligibility and the reason when it is not |
| `create_backup_database` | write | Protect ONE vDB instance with a chosen policy and destination |
| `update_backup_database_policy` | write | Attach a different schedule |
| `start_database_backup` | write | Run a backup now, outside the schedule |
| `enable_backup_database` | write | Resume a paused schedule |
| `disable_backup_database` | write | Pause the schedule; restore points are kept and still billed |
| `delete_backup_database_point` | destructive | Delete ONE restore point |
| `delete_backup_database` | destructive | Delete the backup database **and every restore point it holds** |

Four things differ from the backup-server family and catch people out:

- **`databaseType` is `PostgresCluster` or `RedisCluster`** — a cluster
  spelling, not an engine name. `/v1/protected-resources/databases` answers an
  unrecognised value with an empty list instead of an error, so the tools
  constrain it rather than passing it through.
- **Only cluster deployments can be backed up.** A single-node PostgreSQL is
  ineligible; `list_databases` says so per instance in `ineligible_reason`
  instead of silently omitting it.
- **A backup location holds at most one backup database.** Reusing an occupied
  one is refused with `The backup destination already contains resources.`
- **A vault lock on the location blocks both deletes**, answering
  `Your resource is being managed by Vault.` — unlike the "being processed"
  409, retrying never helps until the retention expires.

`get_feature_guide feature=protect_database` (or the `vbackup_protect_database`
prompt) walks the whole create chain including these.

### History

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_backup_history` | read | vServer backup runs newest-first; **`from_date` — the default window is only 180 days** |
| `list_restore_history` | read | vServer restores that have happened (this server cannot start one) |
| `list_database_backup_history` | read | vDB backup runs, with compressed vs uncompressed size |
| `list_database_restore_history` | read | vDB restores, and which instance the data was written into |

History is per-product and the two families never mix: a vDB run does not appear
in `list_backup_history`. Configuration changes to a destination are a third,
separate trail — `list_backup_destination_history`, which reads account-wide
when `destination_id` is omitted.

### vServer projection

The API publishes a second, vServer-flavoured copy of the backup-server
endpoints. It is not a duplicate: it reports the captured instance's image and
a restore point's per-disk detail, which the generic family does not.

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_vserver_backup_servers` | read | Projection listing; `project_id` is required |
| `get_vserver_backup_server` | read | One backup server, projection shape (**IAM-gated**) |
| `list_vserver_backup_server_points` | read | Restore points with `server_info` — the image behind each point |
| `get_vserver_backup_server_point` | read | One restore point, projection shape (**IAM-gated**) |
| `list_vserver_backup_volume_points` | read | What is inside a restore point: which disk, which was bootable |
| `get_vserver_backup_volume_point` | read | One disk slice of a restore point (**IAM-gated**) |
| `create_vserver_backup_servers` | write | Shortcut create using the platform's default policy and destination |
| `list_volume_usage` | read | Size and used space of vServer volumes — a read expressed as a POST |

### Metrics (vMonitor)

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `get_backup_metrics` | read | Product-wide trend: backup servers, servers, storage used — both regions in one call |
| `get_backup_destination_metrics` | read | Per-location trend: usage and success/failure counts; omit the id to chart every location |

Both post fixed queries to the Backup Center's vMonitor API. vMonitor publishes
exactly six vBackup metrics, so the payloads ship built in and the caller
chooses only the time window — there is no free-form metric query, because an
unknown metric name returns an empty `200` rather than an error.

### Diagnostics and guidance

| Tool | Access | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `get_access_token` | read | Current IAM access token, region and endpoint |
| `get_feature_guide` | read | Step-by-step guidance for a composite vBackup capability |

**IAM-gated** tools answer `403 IAM_PERMISSION_DENIED` for a caller whose
policy does not grant them, while their sibling list tools work. A 403 there
means "not allowed", never "does not exist" — each docstring names the list
tool to fall back to.

## Prompts

Guidance is in Vietnamese, matching the other GreenNode MCP servers. Each is

| `vbackup_protect_database` | The vDB chain: eligibility, choosing a location and policy, and the delete constraints |
| `vbackup_manage_policy` | Schedules, retention, and the platform limits to validate against |
| `vbackup_check_backups` | Did last night's backup run, and why did it fail |
| `vbackup_inspect_restore_point` | What a restore point actually holds — and why a restore must be started in the console |
| `vbackup_manage_backup_server` | Coverage statistics, immediate backups, moving a destination, downloading and deleting restore points |
| `vbackup_manage_destination` | Creating, editing and deleting a backup location — and which settings become irreversible |

## Development

```bash
cd src/vbackup-mcp-server
uv run pytest tests/ -v
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

Manual testing with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run vbackup-mcp-server
```

Against a live gateway (needs credentials in `~/.greennode`):

```bash
uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py --region both   # every read tool over real MCP
./scripts/auth-debug-local.sh                       # the --auth-debug diagnostic
```
